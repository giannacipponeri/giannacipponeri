### Projects

#### 1️⃣ **Agentic RAG: Interviewer, Writer, Critic**  
Created an AI agent system using **OpenAI APIs** and **LangChain** to conduct interviews, generate storybooks, and improve outputs with AI feedback. 

#### 2️⃣ **Extractive Text Summarizer**  
Trained and evaluated models, including a **Neural Network** and **Pre-trained Transformer** to summarize text. Optimized for news articles and deployed via **Streamlit** for interactive use. 

#### 3️⃣ **Housing Price Prediction with ML**  
Developed a **machine learning model** to predict housing prices based on features like location, size, and amenities. The model was implemented and analyzed in a **Jupyter Notebook**. 

#### 4️⃣ **Infrared Thermography for Fever Detection**  
Analyzed infrared thermography data to explore contactless temperature readings for detecting fever. Developed regression and classification models using **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks**.
