## Projects

### 1. **Agentic RAG: Interviewer, Writer, Critic**
- Developed an AI agent system using OpenAI APIs and LangChain. The system conducts interviews, generates storybooks, and improves outputs with AI feedback.

### 2. **Extractive Text Summarizer**
- Trained and evaluated a baseline model, Neural Network, and Pre-trained Transformer to summarize text. Domain-tuned for news articles, optimized for speed, and deployed it via Streamlit for user interaction.

### 4. **Housing Price Prediction Machine Learning**
- Developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features (e.g., location, size, amenities) using regression techniques. Implemented the model in a Jupyter Notebook for easy interaction and analysis.

### 5. **Infrared Thermography for Fever Detection**
- Analyzed the Infrared Thermography Temperature Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository) to explore the potential of contactless temperature readings for detecting fever. The project aimed to develop both regression models to predict oral temperatures and classification models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
